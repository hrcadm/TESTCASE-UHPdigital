Haven't made time spent on website. Managed to set start time but failed to figure out for end time (to compare).
Planned to implement google maps and pin up user location based on geolocation service latitude and longitude, but setting up API key etc. took too much time. I was thinkg of implementing some entertainment third party APIs based on user-data also.
Not much to see basically, but I hope the project is well structured and organised.
